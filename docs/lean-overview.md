# üìö Lean 4: The Mathematical Proof Assistant

## üìã Overview

Lean 4 is a modern, interactive theorem prover and functional programming language developed by Microsoft Research. It represents the cutting edge of formal verification technology, combining rigorous mathematical proof capabilities with practical software development features.

## üéØ Dual Nature of Lean

### Functional Programming Language
Lean serves as a full-featured functional programming language with:
- **Strong static type system** with dependent types
- **Higher-order functions** and parametric polymorphism
- **Algebraic data types** and pattern matching
- **Type inference** and automatic proof automation
- **Metaprogramming** capabilities for extending the language

### Interactive Theorem Prover
As a theorem prover, Lean provides:
- **Formal verification** of mathematical theorems and algorithms
- **Interactive proof development** with step-by-step guidance
- **Automated proof tactics** for common proof patterns
- **Extensible proof language** with user-defined tactics
- **Integration with proof assistants** and mathematical libraries

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Type System
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Universe Hierarchy] --> B[Type 0]
    A --> C[Type 1]
    A --> D[Type 2]
    A --> E[...]

    B --> F[Prop]
    B --> G[Sort 0]

    F --> H[Proofs]
    F --> I[Propositions]

    G --> J[Data Types]
    G --> K[Functions]
```

#### Dependent Types
Lean implements a full dependent type system where:
- **Types can depend on values**: `Vector Œ± n` (vector of n elements of type Œ±)
- **Propositions are types**: Mathematical statements become types that can be inhabited by proofs
- **Proof irrelevance**: All proofs of the same proposition are considered equal
- **Universe polymorphism**: Types can be parameterized over type universes

### Elaboration Engine
The Lean elaboration system:
- **Converts user-friendly syntax** into core type theory
- **Resolves implicit arguments** and type class instances
- **Handles metavariable resolution** during proof development
- **Provides detailed error messages** with proof state information

### Tactic Framework

## üîß Key Features

### Functional Programming Capabilities
```lean
-- Higher-order functions
def map {Œ± Œ≤ : Type} (f : Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤) (xs : List Œ±) : List Œ≤ :=
  match xs with
  | [] => []
  | x :: xs' => f x :: map f xs'

-- Dependent types
def Vector (Œ± : Type) (n : ‚Ñï) : Type :=
  { xs : List Œ± // xs.length = n }

-- Type classes
class Monoid (Œ± : Type) where
  empty : Œ±
  append : Œ± ‚Üí Œ± ‚Üí Œ±
  append_empty : ‚àÄ x, append x empty = x
  empty_append : ‚àÄ x, append empty x = x
```

### Theorem Proving Features
```lean
-- Mathematical theorems with proofs
theorem map_length {Œ± Œ≤ : Type} (f : Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤) (xs : List Œ±) :
  (map f xs).length = xs.length := by
  induction xs with
  | nil => rfl
  | cons x xs' ih =>
    simp [map, ih]
    rfl

-- Proof automation
theorem list_reverse_length {Œ± : Type} (xs : List Œ±) :
  xs.reverse.length = xs.length := by
  induction xs <;> simp [*]
```
