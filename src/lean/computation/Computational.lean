    if low > high then none
    else

      else if xs.get! mid < target then search (mid + 1) high
      else search low (mid - 1)

  | none => ∀ idx : Nat, idx < xs.length → xs.get! idx ≠ target
  := by
  intro h_sorted
  -- Binary search maintains the invariant that if target exists, it's in the current range
  -- This is a complex proof requiring loop invariants

/-- Greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm -/
def gcd_euclidean (a b : Nat) : Nat :=
  let rec gcd (x y : Nat) : Nat :=
    match y with
    | 0 => x

    | some A_BC, some AB_C => A_BC = AB_C
    | _, _ => false
    | _, _ => false
  | _, _ => true  -- Skip if dimensions don't match

  -- Matrix multiplication is associative: (AB)C = A(BC)

    match left, right with
    | [], ys => ys
    | xs, [] => xs
    | x::xs, y::ys =>
      if x ≤ y then x :: merge xs (y::ys)
      else y :: merge (x::xs) ys

  let rec sort (xs : List Nat) (len : Nat) : List Nat :=
    match len, xs with
    | 0, _ => []
    | 1, x::xs => [x]
    | _, _ =>
      let mid := len / 2
      let left := sort xs mid
      let right := sort (xs.drop mid) (len - mid)
      merge left right

  sort xs xs.length

/-- Proof that merge sort produces sorted list -/
theorem merge_sort_sorted (xs : List Nat) : merge_sort xs = xs := by
  -- This would require proving that merge preserves sortedness
  -- and that the recursive structure maintains the invariant
